there is a sql database that can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zzVzLvzXFYihVyTQaouIEuWMAMf57emY

sql tables/joining:
script has project_id and script_id
project has p_id and metadata
block has script_id and block info

will first create a small sample from each that has 500 and 1000 matching project ids, outer joined

SQL code to do above is:

create table project_sample like project;
insert into project_sample
select *
from project
order by rand()
limit 1000;

select * from script
inner join project_sample on project_sample.p_ID=script.project_ID
inner join block on block.Script_ID=script.script_ID;


another note: the sql code above can be used to remove duplicate script and project IDs, and also teh "param*" columns, since they will not be needed for this analysis.
